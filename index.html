            I'd seen a partial eclipse before so I wasn't especially concerned about the imminent total eclipse. The hype, though, was deafening. Folks traveling from across the country, maybe even farther, to little 'ol St. Louis for the big event. Glasses in hand, Allison and I, invited to a friend's rural property for the day, made the drive. Just like any old day of the week so far...  </p>

            <p>At totality, the moon's silhouette completely blocked the sun, allowing us to remove our glasses and see the sun's corona. Twilight-like darkness, stars visible, several astute observers pointing out Jupiter and Venus. A truly extraordinary astronomical event. One of the rare times the hype was right on the money. And we were lucky enough to get a cloudless day for it.
